# OMG (Oh My GitHub) workflow

The canonical workflow is `.github/workflows/opencode.yml`.
The numbered build, verification, remediation, completion, and screenshot
prompt templates are stored as Markdown files in `.github/prompts/`.

## Trigger

Create the issue with `OpenCode` and requested mode labels, to start `.github/workflows/opencode.yml` through `issues.opened`. Install this listener
on the default branch first. Run `opencode-prepare.yml` on the Actions runner
to verify author access and resolve the target branch.
Pass validated outputs to `opencode-reusable.yml` only after approval.

Use the issue body as the request, or its title when the body is empty. Add
`Goal` to select `opencode run --command goal` with
`noInterruptOnUserMessage: true`. Omit `Goal` for the standard invocation.

An issue with the `ralph` label installs the standalone
[`opencode-ralph-loop`](https://github.com/charfeng1/opencode-ralph-loop) plugin
and starts `opencode run --command ralph-loop` in the same workflow session.
Ralph takes precedence when both `Goal` and `ralph` are present, which makes it
safe to add `ralph` to the usual Goal-labeled issue. The workflow requires
Ralph's `<promise>DONE</promise>` completion marker before validation and
completion reporting.

Use the App installation helper or install the caller manually. Set repository
variable `OPENCODE_ACCESS=everyone` to accept any issue author.
Attach the execution label when creating the issue. Leave the variable unset
to require write, maintain, or admin access.

Attach `OpenCode` and `test` for synthetic generation. Copy the fixture project, import a completed synthetic conversation into the real OpenCode server, and run the production lifecycle for checkpoint, startup, capture, and deployment. Require a ready deployment with screenshots before marking the test complete. Keep the normal diagnostic logs release.

The workflow uses the `macos-latest` GitHub-hosted runner by default for the
entire OpenCode job. The `linux` label opts the run into `ubuntu-latest`.

Store `branch` in an `omgithub-request:v1` JSON HTML comment to select project checkout.
Validate this branch during preparation and freeze its commit as `target_sha`.
Use `target_ref` for the result base. Use the default branch when no branch metadata
exists. When the metadata selects another branch, let default-branch preparation
dispatch `opencode.yml` at that branch and stop. Run preparation and OpenCode
from the selected branch workflow. Use the central workflow revision pinned by
that branch's caller.

Read the [Oh My Github App documentation](https://github.com/AgentsLoop/omsite/blob/main/wiki/oh-my-github-app.md) for
App ownership, installation scope, permissions, events, and webhook details.

An issue labeled `omo` additionally installs and configures the OpenCode Ultimate
edition of `oh-my-openagent` with Bun before the OpenCode server starts. The
installer runs non-interactively with provider authentication skipped; `/omo` is
not a command and does not trigger a run by itself. An `omo`-labeled OpenCode run
uses OMO's native `goal` command and prepends `ulw` to the objective. The Codex
Light `ulw-loop` component is not recreated or registered for OpenCode.

## Run the job

1. Register run/attempt identity before runtime checkout. Preserve detailed Actions progress throughout execution.
2. Check out the target and runtime. Install worker instructions and optional label policies.
3. Start optional SSH access, OpenCode, and the control/app tunnels. Route project files through the control tunnel.
4. Initialize the project once. Restore saved conversations and start saved apps before submitting resumed work.
5. Run the model, or import synthetic generation for test requests. Publish real session URLs.
6. Let the lifecycle controller checkpoint every completed main response. Execute startup and capture directly; fork OC only to repair broken scripts.
7. Record local readiness before public checks. Retry temporary tunnel/capture failures without restarting a healthy app.
8. Package declared static output and fresh screenshots. Retry the same upload archive and generation.
9. Store deployed screenshots in OmSite. Post the durable preview link to GitHub. Preserve successful publication if reporting fails.
10. Store diagnostic logs and response JSON in a run logs release. Reuse the checkpoint export only when its session revision matches current OpenCode metadata.
11. Keep normal live access available for five hours. Save changed state and end registration during shutdown.

Validation is controlled by the repository variable `VALIDATION_ENABLED`. It
defaults to `true`. When set to `off` (or any value other than `true`), the
workflow stops after the initial OpenCode prompt and temporary OpenCode Web
trycloudflare exposure; app verification/remediation, completion and screenshot
prompts, Git delivery, immutable project publication, release/report generation, and the
complete label are skipped. The temporary access session still sleeps for five
hours before cleanup.

After the branch is pushed, the completion report links the repository path to
OmGithub. Opening that URL anonymously resolves the named branch and optional
project directory, discovers root `index.html` or `dist/index.html`, and creates
the store page and playable deployment. Keep the full
commit-SHA URL working for compatibility. There is no separate publishing
credential or upload step.
Read [OmGithub publishing](https://github.com/AgentsLoop/omsite/blob/main/wiki/omgithub.md).

The OmGithub issue workspace polls issue comments every eight seconds. Its
header contains the four numbered workflow stages plus the currently executing
stage and description. On desktop it shows the live OpenCode session on the
left and the newest progress screenshot or playable preview on the right. At
the mobile breakpoint, Chat and Preview tabs keep only one iframe visible at a
time. Numbered preview controls retain access to every progress and final
screenshot found in issue comments.

The comment URL opens `/<encoded-worktree>/session/<session-id>` rather than
the web home page. This matters because the web home page stores its project
selection in the browser, while the runner's project exists only on the
temporary GitHub Actions filesystem.

## Local tracker test

On macOS, run `./scripts/test-opencode-progress-tracker.sh`. It starts a local
mock OpenCode HTTP server with nested, active, and completed child sessions,
including user and tool image attachments, then asserts the three derived
progress counters.

The workflow uses the built-in OpenCode model path and does not require an
`OPENCODE_API_KEY` secret. To authenticate an ephemeral worker with the Mac's
OpenAI OAuth login, save the complete local OpenCode `auth.json` as the
`OPENCODE_AUTH_JSON` repository secret; the workflow passes it through
OpenCode's `OPENCODE_AUTH_CONTENT` environment variable. Branch creation and
pushing are deliberately handled by the workflow rather than by OpenCode's
GitHub integration.

## Findings: tracking the GitHub run in Web UI

The previous GitHub integration installed the OpenCode CLI and ran:

```sh
opencode github run
```

The workflow now sends the comment text directly to `opencode run --attach --dir
<project-directory>`. The explicit directory is required when the CLI attaches
to a separately started OpenCode server; without it, the CLI can answer while
the resulting session is not visible in the intended Web UI workspace.

For the installed `opencode-goal-plugin`, invoke a goal from the non-interactive
CLI with `opencode run --command goal "<objective>"`; passing `/goal <objective>`
as the message sends literal text instead of invoking the custom command. To
send a follow-up to the same attached session, use `opencode run --attach
<server-url> --session <session-id> "<message>"`. In this workflow, the
issue text is passed directly as the objective before it is passed to the custom
command, and later human messages steer the running goal instead of
pausing it.

Before starting OpenCode, the workflow checks out `agents-dev/skills` into
`$PROJECT_DIR/.agents`. OpenCode discovers project skills from
`$PROJECT_DIR/.agents/skills/**/SKILL.md`.
The workflow excludes this nested skills checkout through `.git/info/exclude`
so it cannot be included in the generated app commit.
The workflow verifies the discovered skill list through OpenCode's `/skill`
endpoint and synchronizes `model/<provider>/<name>` and `skill/<name>` labels
in the repository.
This keeps the regular OpenCode session while making branch and immutable
commit behavior explicit and reviewable in YAML.
Model labels are refreshed from the live OpenCode catalog on each run and are
limited to models with zero input, output, and cache-read cost, plus the
explicitly allowed `opencode/gpt-5.6-luna` and `openai/gpt-5.6-luna` models.
Use `model/openai/gpt-5.6-luna` when the OpenAI provider is required. Default GitHub labels are removed, and
the triggering issue is marked `in progress`, `validating`, `complete`, or
`failed` as the job advances.
For difficult game requests, the `game-issue-e2e` skill selects the synchronized
`model/opencode/muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free` label; if that label is
unavailable, the skill records that it used the workflow default instead.

The workflow reads the repository variable `PROJECT_DIR` as a repository-relative
project home. It defaults to `./`.
Absolute paths and parent-directory traversal are rejected. OpenCode Web and all
OpenCode runs use the resolved directory, and skill checkout, Git delivery,
and screenshot links use the same project home. OpenCode's server
also loads project instances per request using the `x-opencode-directory` header.
A tunneled browser request does not know the runner's `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, so
the UI can appear empty even while `opencode github run` is actively working.

The reliable architecture is:

```text
opencode github run
        |
        v
shared OpenCode session/database
        ^
        | x-opencode-directory: $PROJECT_DIR
        |
trycloudflare tunnel -> workspace-scoped OpenCode Web UI
```

The workflow starts OpenCode from `$PROJECT_DIR`, so its direct server is
already scoped to the checked-out worktree. API and session probes explicitly
send `x-opencode-directory: $PROJECT_DIR`, while Cloudflare tunnels directly
to that same loopback server. This avoids an extra reverse-proxy hop and keeps
WebSocket upgrades native. The access comment points to the encoded
canonical worktree/session route, so the browser opens the live run directly.
The resolver emits the repository root without a trailing `/.`; this keeps the
encoded browser route identical to OpenCode's canonical session directory. A loaded
Web UI or healthy tunnel alone does not prove session tracking; acceptance
requires a screenshot while the run is active.

## Repository settings

- For runner-side SSH access and verification, configure the
  `AGENTSWEB_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY` Actions secret with the public key matching the Mac
  private key described in [access.md](access.md). Without it, the workflow
  skips SSH setup and verification but still exposes the OpenCode Web session.

## Verify OpenCode installation

Install OpenCode with the official `https://opencode.ai/install` script and
the selected release version. Add `$HOME/.opencode/bin` to the current shell
and `GITHUB_PATH`. Link the installed binary at `/usr/local/bin/opencode`
for fresh SSH shells. Verify `opencode --version` after installation and
from a new Bash process. Do not depend on installer changes to shell profiles
for non-interactive Actions or SSH commands.

## Resume saved games

Save code and the main public conversation after each completed response with `scripts/session-checkpoint.mjs`.
Save again before closing temporary access. Keep the five-hour access period.
Reuse one checkpoint release per issue. Upload separate conversation and manifest assets. Switch the manifest pointer after verifying uploads.
Retain earlier complete releases. Exclude credentials, dependencies, and runner files.

Restore version 2 checkpoints with matching repository, issue, commit, and OpenCode version.
Import the complete conversation and submit only the next requested change.
Use a new issue and result branch. Keep the source game's publication unchanged.
Mark games without complete checkpoints as **Resume unavailable**.
Run `node --test scripts/session-checkpoint.test.mjs` to verify the checkpoint cycle.

Preserve transcript text and tool results when importing. Remove provider-bound replay IDs, encrypted reasoning, and signatures before submitting to a new runner's provider session.
Set `OPENCODE_DEBUG_HOLD=true` only in a debugging repository to retain failed live runners for the normal five-hour access period. Use `scripts/ssh-run-log.sh` to inspect the live worker. Remove the variable after debugging.

## Restore the main session and preview

Keep `checkpoint-session-id` set to the main session. Save the latest workspace files with that conversation. Submit the exact user prompt to the restored main session. Preserve whitespace and bypass command wrappers. Run scripted capture after each completed response. Reject saved child sessions instead of importing them as main conversations.

Provision the default start.sh before main OpenCode runs. Install dependencies, build when required, and serve port 3000 in the foreground. Test from a stopped app without installed dependencies. Start control and app tunnels during worker setup. Serve files through the control proxy. Run the saved script before submitting resumed work. Publish the restored preview only after local and public HTTP checks pass. Reuse the app tunnel for delivery. Run capture.sh against the ready preview. Repair missing or failing scripts in an OC repair fork; execute the repaired scripts and inspect their screenshots. Inspect `app.log` for startup failures.

## Save and deploy main-session responses

Run `scripts/session-lifecycle.mjs` once before exposing the web tunnel. Route browser requests through its control port. Read `main-model` after execution-label resolution. Register the main session before reconciling idle events.

Save each completed main response through `scripts/session-checkpoint.mjs`. Keep one issue release and separate JSON assets. Validate through `scripts/session-deploy.mjs` in the main workspace against the shared live server. Cancel validation before forwarding new web messages. Preserve the last successful deployment and reject obsolete generations. Save changed state during shutdown without starting validation.

Run `node --test scripts/session-lifecycle.test.mjs scripts/session-checkpoint.test.mjs scripts/opencode-prepare.test.mjs scripts/opencode-reporting.test.mjs`. Run `actionlint .github/workflows/opencode.yml .github/workflows/opencode-reusable.yml`.

## Restore cross-repository checkpoints

- Fetch the saved checkpoint commit from the metadata source repository before restoring it.
- Keep the destination origin for result pushes. Do not require source checkpoint branches in the destination.
- Test cross-repository restore when a copied game branch does not contain the separate checkpoint commit.

## Recover shared preview startup

Run the existing project startup and capture scripts directly after each checkpoint. Reuse the healthy preview on port 3000; start it when stopped. Accept PORT in start.sh and serve in the foreground. Check local and public HTTP readiness. Accept CAPTURE_URL and CAPTURE_DIR in capture.sh; capture fresh final-desktop.png and final-mobile.png outside source, close the capture browser, and leave the server running. Invoke an OC repair fork only for missing or failing scripts, with at most two repairs. Require OC to execute its changes and inspect both screenshots. Save repaired setup with the main conversation export. Publish only after scripted startup and capture succeed. Cancel deployment when main continues and reject superseded deployment generations. Retain the last successful draft and diagnostic evidence on failure. Store SSH connectivity-test keys in runner.temp and retain the Mac authorized key.

## Separate script lifecycles

Provision missing project scripts after checkpoint restore and before main OC starts. Execute startup.sh once per worker from the project directory; keep its default empty except for the Bash header and strict mode. Store project-specific prerequisites there. Stop initialization on failure. Apply new setup commands manually in the current worker when a repair changes this hook.

Use start.sh for repeatable application startup and capture.sh for screenshot capture. Preserve customized scripts. Use the shared Node helpers through RUNTIME_DIR on macOS and Linux. Detect npm/Vite projects before standalone HTML, install dependencies when their manifest changes, build Vite output into dist, and serve on PORT defaulting to 3000. Customize start.sh and deployment output for other frameworks. Set CAPTURE_READY_SELECTOR for application-specific rendering readiness. Keep browser installation in worker infrastructure and capture output outside source.

Adopt the new script contract directly. Create new checkpoints using startup.sh for initialization and start.sh for the server.

## Register and deliver current runs

Register structured run state through scripts/run-record.mjs. Send a heartbeat every 30 seconds from the controller. Persist tunnel URLs in web-url and app-url. Route project files through /omgithub/files/ on the control tunnel. Preserve directory listing, MIME types, and relative navigation.

Declare the static deployment directory in OPENCODE_WEB_DIR/deployment-output.json with absolute project and directory fields. Use the shared default starter to write this declaration for HTML and Vite. Write the same declaration from custom start.sh scripts. Restart the app when its recorded checkpoint differs from the current checkpoint. Capture the resulting server before packaging that declared output.

Keep deployment success separate from result reporting. Retry reporting independently and retain capture evidence on failure. Generate the human-readable deployment report from the controller result. Read readiness from structured run/deployment state. Require a version 2 checkpoint and an explicit release manifest pointer. Supply branch selection as omgithub-request:v1 metadata.

## Keep state and tests deterministic

Use the bootstrap request only before the lifecycle starts. Let the lifecycle own later connectivity updates. Keep deployment state out of heartbeat payloads. Keep checkpoint manifests and conversations separate from deployment screenshots.

Use monotonically ordered synthetic message IDs. OpenCode sorts messages by ID; random IDs can put the user after the completed assistant and prevent reconciliation. Verify imported message order before writing the main-session marker.

Return capture exit 75 for temporary navigation/browser failures. Return exit 1 for script or rendering defects. Preserve bounded retries and diagnostics.
